# Markdown Compiler
**An easy and fast Markdown compiler from JSON written in NodeJS**

This small code can be really helpful with your static website or similar projects. For example it could be used to write tons of products cards in seconds. Using a simple additional online software like CSVtoJSON you could also generate and mantain updated your client's catalog starting from their EXCEL file.

**Easy and Frictionless**

## Instructions
Before to get starting you will have to configure your own version of the generator.

The files you might have to change are:

- app.js
- template/markdownTemplate.md
- content.json

Search the notices in **app.js** and follow the instructions

Example of a notice:
```shell
/* *********** HACKING NEEDED HERE *********** //

Copy and paste the code below and hack it accordingly

checkDirectory("./resul...
```

In the other files is pretty easy to get what you must do. No explanation deserved ;)

Hope you find it useful. Enjoy
